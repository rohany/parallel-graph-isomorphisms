use the dfs parallel scheduler

frontier = generatePossiblePairs, depth?

when we get a work request, we copy our state, and give them the frontier? -
need to make sure they get at the right level? add next levels to a second frontier?


extend pasl while with this steal function

optimization ideas:
use restrict when you know the pointers are different - allows for optimization
