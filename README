Beginning work on implementation of parallel graph isomorphisms.

Current work so far is just setting up the code needed to run
a serial version of the VF2 algorithm.

Style Guidelines : File names should begin with capital letters,
and each file name should be the name of the class that is being
either defined or implemented in the file. For in file style,
follow clang-format.

Journal :

9/25/2017 : Changed to stack idea with extra data - works.

9/20/2017 : Finished serial matcher, and it works!

9/10/2017 : Filled in more code in Matcher, State. Need to
implement generate candidate pairs and flesh out some
logistics in Matcher, and then can start testing the
sequential code.

9/9/2017 : Added extra data to Graph, changed it to store
both an Adjacency List and an Adjacency Matrix - want fast
edge lookups, and cheap neighbors iteration as well. Since
we allocate this upfront, and its read only, I think it will
be fine.

9/8/2017 : Added more C++ source files, fully implemented and
test an adjacency matrix graph structure. Graph structure has
alot of room available for optimization, which is noted in the class.
Implemented skeleton code for State and Matcher classes.

9/7/2017 : Created directory. Began defining header files for classes
like Graph, State and Matcher, as well as sketching out some ideas
for representing the graph in a way that will condusive to implementing
the VF2 algorithm first serially, then in parallel.
